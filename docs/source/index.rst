Getting Started
===============
PEAL is a python package enabling the user to easily find solutions to optimization problems by
creating implementations of basic evolutionary algorithms.

The code is highly object-oriented.
Other packages in this field (such as `DEAP <https://github.com/DEAP/deap>`_) seem
to implement the algorithms in a non-pythonic way and while this coding style supplies much more
flexibility, the user also has to write more code for each new application.

PEAL aims to minimize to code a user has to write in order to implement basic algorithms.
The hard part here is figuring out how this can be achieved while also trying to
maximize the number of different methods and algorithms the user can access.
A major part of PEAL will also be an advanced type hinting structure. This automatically
increases readability and allows easier code management.

To get a basic feeling on the structure of the package, I encourage you to dig through
some of the topics listed below (in the order they appear). This documentation was quickly created
to format code docstring in a better way and add some comments to them. Future updates will expand
these pages and hopefully provide more detail.
