Getting Started
===============
PEAL is a python package enabling the user to easily find solutions to optimization problems by
creating implementations of basic evolutionary algorithms.

This project started as a collection of classes that help me finish some homework tasks for
university. Also, I felt like other packages in this field (such as
`DEAP <https://github.com/DEAP/deap>`_) seem to implement the algorithms in a non-pythonic way
without using an here naturally suited object-oriented approach.
This implementation style supplies a much higher variety of things that can be done with these
packages with the drawback of having to write more code for each new application.

PEAL wants the user to write only as much code as really is needed to get the given problem
solved. The hard part here will be figuring out how this can be achieved while also trying to
maximize the number of different methods and algorithms one can access.
A major part of PEAL will also be an advanced type hinting structure. This automatically
increases readability and helps understanding the code.

To get a basic feeling on the structure of the package, I encourage you to dig through
some of the topics listed below (in the order they appear). This documentation was quickly created
to format code docstring in a better way and add some comments to them. Future updates will expand
these pages and hopefully provide more detail.
