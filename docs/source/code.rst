Getting Started
---------------
Before starting to implement your own PEAL-powered evolutionary algorithm,
choose a type of process you want to use, listed in the module
:py:mod:`peal.process`.

These classes allow the configuration of evolutionary processes that are used
to solve optimization problems in different ways.
